<h2>Blazor Tutorial</h2>

Blazor is a modern front-end web framework (part of the .NET platform) based on html, css, and C# to help you build websites faster. It's essentially Microsoft's version of Facebook's React. It allows for both front end and back end development using a single development stack.

Blazor Hybrid is essentially blending both web and mobile apps.

<h3>Blazor</h3>
<p><strong>Client-Side and Server-Side:</strong> Blazor can run on the client-side using WebAssembly (Blazor WebAssembly) or on the server-side (Blazor Server). Blazor WebAssembly allows you to run C# code directly in the browser, while Blazor Server runs on the server and uses SignalR to communicate with the client.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Page Applications (SPA):</strong> Blazor is designed for building SPAs, where the application runs in the browser and interacts with the server only when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Component-Based:</strong> Blazor uses a component-based architecture, similar to frameworks like React or Angular. Components are reusable UI elements that can be nested, shared, and managed independently.</p>
<p><strong>C# and .NET:</strong> Blazor allows you to write both client-side and server-side code in C#, leveraging the .NET ecosystem for libraries and tools.</p>

<h3>ASP.NET Core</h3>
<p><strong>Server-Side Framework:</strong> ASP.NET Core is primarily a server-side framework for building web applications and APIs. It handles HTTP requests and responses, routing, and server-side logic.</p>
<p><strong>MVC and Razor Pages:</strong> ASP.NET Core supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and Razor Pages, which are used to build dynamic web pages with server-side rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Middleware Pipeline:</strong> ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline to handle HTTP requests. This allows for a modular approach to adding functionality like authentication, logging, and error handling.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p><strong>Blazor:</strong> Ideal for building rich, interactive web applications with a lot of client-side logic. It’s a good choice if you prefer to use C# and .NET for both client and server code.</p>
<p><strong>ASP.NET Core:</strong> Best suited for building robust server-side applications, APIs, and services. It’s a great choice for applications that require complex server-side logic, data processing, and integration with other systems.</p>

<p><strong>In summary,</strong> Blazor is focused on client-side interactivity and SPAs, while ASP.NET Core is a versatile server-side framework for building web applications and APIs. Your choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of your project and your preference for client-side versus server-side development.</p>
