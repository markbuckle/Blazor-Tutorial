<h2>Blazor Tutorial</h2>

<h3>Blazor</h3>
<strong>Client-Side and Server-Side:</strong> Blazor can run on the client-side using WebAssembly (Blazor WebAssembly) or on the server-side (Blazor Server). Blazor WebAssembly allows you to run C# code directly in the browser, while Blazor Server runs on the server and uses SignalR to communicate with the client.
<strong>Single-Page Applications (SPA):</strong> Blazor is designed for building SPAs, where the application runs in the browser and interacts with the server only when necessary.
<strong>Component-Based:</strong> Blazor uses a component-based architecture, similar to frameworks like React or Angular. Components are reusable UI elements that can be nested, shared, and managed independently.
C# and .NET: Blazor allows you to write both client-side and server-side code in C#, leveraging the .NET ecosystem for libraries and tools.<br>

<h3>ASP.NET Core</h3>
<p><strong>Server-Side Framework:</strong> ASP.NET Core is primarily a server-side framework for building web applications and APIs. It handles HTTP requests and responses, routing, and server-side logic.</p>
<strong>MVC and Razor Pages:</strong> ASP.NET Core supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and Razor Pages, which are used to build dynamic web pages with server-side rendering.
<strong>Middleware Pipeline:</strong> ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline to handle HTTP requests. This allows for a modular approach to adding functionality like authentication, logging, and error handling.
<strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<h4>Use Cases</h4>
<strong>Blazor:</strong> Ideal for building rich, interactive web applications with a lot of client-side logic. It’s a good choice if you prefer to use C# and .NET for both client and server code.
<strong>ASP.NET Core:</strong> Best suited for building robust server-side applications, APIs, and services. It’s a great choice for applications that require complex server-side logic, data processing, and integration with other systems.

<strong>In summary,</strong> Blazor is focused on client-side interactivity and SPAs, while ASP.NET Core is a versatile server-side framework for building web applications and APIs. Your choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of your project and your preference for client-side versus server-side development.
